The traditional monograph doesn\u2019t always account for the labor of discovery and archiving that is a part of research. When copyright and ethics allow, authors will be able to share these archives with readers through Manifold. Stephanie Boluk and Patrick Lemieux are currently authoring their first book, tentatively titled \u201cMetgaming: Videogames and the Practice of Play,\u201d which studies a critical practice and form of game design philosophy in which playing games, making games, and thinking about games occur simultaneously.

We also hope Manifold will help to make \u201cMetagaming\u201d more accessible for students by offering additional educational resources like a podcast we are in the process of planning in which we interview metagamers featured in the chapters and 20-min video summaries discussing the content of each chapter.")),Object(i.b)("p",null," This willingness to think beyond the book is what acquisitions editors are looking for in Manifold projects.

Danielle Kasprzak is Humanities Editor at the press and also acquires and oversees the press\u2019s Forerunners: Ideas First program, which publishes thoughts-in-process as digital works and as affordable print publications.

For Mills, this pre-publication aspect of Manifold will be "a way to curate my sound materials, write a few introductory provocations, and invite others to think with me about what it means to read.\u201d This notion of curation is critical to what I am looking for in a Manifold book project. Manifold will track a work as it is conceptualized, researched, written, and read, giving readers access to primary research documents and data, links to related archives, rich media, social media, and reading tools. Taking advantage of these tools, an author will also become a curator, shaping archives, providing context for readers, and illustrating the varied parts that make up her book and larger research project. It will ask authors to collaborate with the press on questions of copyright and ethics, peer review and evaluation, and to consider how best to connect with readers (both within the academy and general readers) in meaningful ways. Manifold will recode the very definition of the scholarly monograph. To realize that goal, we are looking for authors whose vision for their scholarly projects extends beyond the limitations of the traditional book. \u2014 Jason Weidemann,',"\xa0","Editorial Director"))}c.isMDXComponent=!0},255:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return d})),a.d(t,"b",(function(){return p}));var o=a(0),r=a.n(o);function i(e,t,a){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function n(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(o=o.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,o)}return a}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?n(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){i(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):n(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function l(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,o,r=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,o,r={},i=Object.keys(e);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)a=i[o],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(r[a]=e[a]);return r}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)a=i[o],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(r[a]=e[a])}return r}var h=r.a.createContext({}),c=function(e){var t=r.a.useContext(h),a=t;return e&&(a="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),a},d=function(e){var t=c(e.components);return r.a.createElement(h.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},u={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,{},t)}},f=r.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var a=e.components,o=e.mdxType,i=e.originalType,n=e.parentName,h=l(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),d=c(a),f=o,p=d["".concat(n,".").concat(f)]||d[f]||u[f]||i;return a?r.a.createElement(p,s(s({ref:t},h),{},{components:a})):r.a.createElement(p,s({ref:t},h))}));function p(e,t){var a=arguments,o=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||o){var i=a.length,n=new Array(i);n[0]=f;var s={};for(var l in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,l)&&(s[l]=t[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:o,n[1]=s;for(var h=2;h<i;h++)n[h]=a[h];return r.a.createElement.apply(null,n)}return r.a.createElement.apply(null,a)}f.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
