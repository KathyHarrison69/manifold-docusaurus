Mellon Foundation and one from the National Endowment for the Humanities, allowing Manifold to solidify its structure for future sustainability and to expand its work as a leading provider of digital Open Educational Resources (OERs).

Last week Terence was in Montreal, Quebec, meeting with the three-person staff of Concordia University Press, which was established in 2016 and will this fall publish its first books.“It's exciting for a new scholarly publisher like Concordia University Press to be a part of this pilot,” noted interim director Geoffrey Little. “We look forward to learning how Manifold can help us publish our peer-reviewed open-access books.”Despite priding himself as being directionally adept, Terence found himself a bit misplaced when he made his way to the Webster Library—home of the press—for the first sessions of the trip. “I was a bit early, and as I was making my way around a woman who had walked past me just a moment prior called out my name. It was Meredith Carruthers, the press’s Editorial and Production Coordinator; she recognized me from my email avatar. That was definitely a first, especially given how bad I am at making avatars of myself.”After introductions and a brief tour, Terence led Meredith and the press’s intern Charles on a guided tour of the platform, beginning with its origins and aims, demoing its present capabilities, and concluding with a review of the roadmap for future development. “I always love doing this opening session because it really reveals what the system is and serves as a catalyst for so many of the discussions that come in the later sessions.”]]></summary>

Last week Terence was in Seattle, Washington, meeting with groups from the University of Washington Press and Libraries. Due to Washington’s interest in Manifold as a tool for Open Educational Resources (OER), and more generally for classroom use, Terence was joined by Krystyna Michael, Open Educational Technologist at the Graduate Center, CUNY. The University of Washington team, spearheaded by Beth Fuget at the press and Elliott Stevens, Verletta Kern, and Liz Bedford from the library side, welcomed Terence and Krystyna for a few days of meetings. After landing on Monday, Terence and Krystyna had a whirlwind tour of the press (with homemade scones) where they ran a quick demo of Manifold for Press Director Nicole Mitchell and the bulk of the editorial team. They then made for the library where they introduced Manifold’s main features before discussing how to structure projects, curate content, map project development, and work with authors from teaching and publishing perspectives. They finished (amid cookies) with a close review of the development roadmap, an exploration of how other institutions are using Manifold, and how Manifold is situated against other players in the community.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[mkgold-gc-15Before the holidays, I had the chance to chat with Manifold Co-PI Matthew K. Gold, who is Associate Professor of English and Digital Humanities and Executive Officer of the M.A. Program in Liberal Studies at the Graduate Center, CUNY. I have been lucky to work with Matt for a couple of years now, through seminars on digital humanities praxis and textual studies, on DH tool-building projects like DH Box, on the editorial collective of the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, and with the digital fellows of the GC Digital Initiatives. His widespread commitment to textual scholarship and digital innovation, his seemingly tireless support of his students and digital experimentation, and his humility (which he may not even let me mention) never cease to amaze me. I have spent a lot of time discussing Manifold with Matt, but I was glad to get the chance to ask him more specifically about his personal motivations for developing a hybrid publishing platform.&nbsp; -- What matters most to you about Manifold? &nbsp;I think it’s the overall excellence&nbsp;of the user experience. Our goal is to create a platform that will rival the reading experience of a commercial site like Medium but that is free and open-source. I’m excited to see how various people will use it -- certainly our primary audience of university presses, but also a wider set of authors and publishers of all types. Cool. That sounds like a pretty noble mission to me.&nbsp; I’m also excited about our team -- we have the University of Minnesota Press, which is doing exciting experimentation on both its editorial and production sides -- &nbsp;it’s a Press that’s willing to take risks with the way it thinks about the future of publishing. Working with a partner like that -- and with Doug Armato and his team in particular -- is a lot of fun.. And then we are lucky to be collaborating with Cast Iron Coding-- Zach Davis and his team are extremely talented and very much aware of the latest trends in web development. Manifold won’t feel like a typical piece of academic technology, thanks to the work of Zach and his team. What’s your ideal reading experience?&nbsp; For me, print is still most important as a reading experience. But I’m never satisfied when I buy a printed book from a bookstore and then “that’s it.” I can’t carry all of my books with me when I go on a trip, so I really want both print and digital at the point of purchase. For me, if I’m going to read a book of theory or criticism, I’m going to be reading it in print, but I also want to be able to easily pull it up on my laptop or phone when I’m traveling or just happen to think of it during a meeting with a student, or I’m doing some writing and I want to refer to it. I want the materiality of the print book, but for access and reference, the online version. And Manifold is precisely about achieving that hybrid experience. So we are producing print books, but we are also creating web-based interactive texts that open up new collective and social reading experiences. What are you reading now?&nbsp; I am reading (and loving) Barbarian Days by William Finnegan.&nbsp;Somehow, reading about waves feels&nbsp;like the right thing in this post-election moment--an escape from politics but also a reminder of how to make our way among larger and sometimes brutal forces. Who inspires your work?&nbsp; I tend to be inspired by my academic mentors. My first academic mentor was Robert D. Richardson, Jr., who is a biographer of Thoreau and Emerson (his biography of Emerson remains one of my favorite books). I’m still in awe of his erudition and research and writing skills. I’m also inspired on a daily level by my colleagues at the Graduate Center and across CUNY, especially by the students I work with. --After Matt answered all the questions, we had the chance to speak more broadly about Manifold and the features that specifically address readers’ needs. The design of the platform -- from the icons, to commenting and annotation, to the reading interface -- is the result of careful consideration by a team of careful readers. Moving forward, even as I share more about the creators of Manifold and the reading practices that influence its development, I will be adding a features&nbsp;series to outline the thinking that goes into the various components of Manifold.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I last posted, we've been making development progress on a few different fronts. Much of this work is still in feature branches, and has yet to be merged into the main development branch. Therefore, I'm going to skip the full list of revisions in this post, and instead offer a high level description of our recent efforts. Markdown and GitBook Support Fundamentally, Manifold has been conceived as a tool for university presses. When it comes to thinking about how it will be used, UMNP has guided our thinking about what problems presses are trying to solve, and how Manifold can help. That said, I think everyone on the project has also been interested in the ways in which Manifold can be a useful tool for the broader academic community. At the very least, we want to make it possible for individuals to find ways to use Manifold. One impediment to this, in my mind, has been the fact that to date Manifold only accepts finished EPUB documents as an input format, and independent scholars and self-publishers may find it difficult to come up with finished EPUBs. EPUBs are essentially packages containing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In a sense, an EPUB is a small, self-contained website, and EPUB readers are offline, limited browsers. HTML, therefore, is already an input format that Manifold understands and can work with. What this means is that any document type that can easily be converted to HTML can likely be consumed by Manifold and made available to readers. We refer to the process of slurping a book up into Manifold as "Ingestion." Manifold can be extended by adding ingestion strategies to it. An ingestion strategy tells Manifold how to map a source document—eg, an EPUB—to a format it can understand. In short, we've anticipated that we'll want to ingest other kinds of documents and have left places where other developers can create their own strategies.&nbsp;With the aim of testing out this approach and also furthering our goal of increasing Manifold's user base, we spent a couple days writing a Markdown strategy that supports the GitBook format. This means that users will be able to feed Manifold a set of nested Markdown documents, which Manifold will then be able to make available online, just as it does an EPUB. Manifold's documentation, for example, is authored following the GitBook format, and it can now be read within Manifold itself. Three cheers for eating our own dog food! Backend Development Since I last posted, we've also been hard at work at building out the backend interfaces. Most of the basic backend HTML and CSS has been completed, and we're now in the process of developing reusable patterns and components in React to wire up the backend forms to the API. This has been challenging, as there is a lot of functionality required in Manifold's admin interface, and figuring out how to model the requisite state while keeping in our Flux architecture has required some thinking. We're close on this, with some initial proof of concept work, which I'll be discussing more in subsequent posts. That's it for today! We'll be posting&nbsp;more updates (hopefully with screenshots and some design comps) later this week. &nbsp; &nbsp;]]></summary>

I always find these meetings inspiring and invigorating, and am reminded of what a strong team we have in place for this project. In the two weeks leading up to this meeting, the development and design team at Cast Iron has been working furiously to tighten up existing behavior and progress on the project resources. As a result, we don't have a lot in the way of big new features to report for this sprint. We do, however, have a long list of fixes, small improvements, and tweaks, which I'm including below.

Last&nbsp;week, in the midst of national turmoil, I had the pleasure of interviewing Susan Doerr, University of Minnesota Press Assistant Director, Digital Publishing and Operations. During our phone call, I asked Susan a number of questions about her thoughts on reading and the Manifold platform.I started by asking Susan what matters most to her about Manifold. She talked about the process of collaborating with the Manifold team on writing the grant proposal, and thinking about publishing books in the browser. Susan believes the real revolution of an epub or pdf ebook is the speed of distribution -- instant access for a reader. Susan said, “ebook reading devices are siloed -- a reader is stuck in an app or device.” What the Manifold team wanted to do was “break free from that constraint. Ebooks today are replications of print -- active media that don't do much more than the print edition of a book. And we wanted to do more.”Publishing a book in the browser allows it to be dynamic -- vs static. The more they thought about it, the more opportunity they saw for readers to follow a project as it evolve because Manifold can publish a project iteratively, that is, in pieces over time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks for joining me for another installation of "This Week in Manifold." First off, please accept my apologies for missing last week's update. When last Friday rolled around, we had a number of updates ready to go out to our staging site. However, when it was time to deploy, we hit a few unexpected problems. DevOps, Hosting Manifold, and Deployment This release adds a new metadata field to projects. Because the exact metadata requirements are difficult to pin down and may change from press to press, we wanted a relatively flexible approach to storing project, text, and resource metadata. Back in the day, we might have used an EAV model for this, but there are many well-documented drawbacks to that model. Because Manifold uses PostgreSQL as its database backend, we have access to a variety of field types for storing arbitrary amounts of data. In the past, we've used HSTORE for storing key/value pairs, but&nbsp;in this case we wanted something more flexible that could store different data types (HSTORE stores strings, but we want to store integers, boolean values, strings, arrays, etc). Recent versions of PostgreSQL include the JSONB field type, which is exactly what we want in this case. Alas, that meant that the October 28th&nbsp;release required&nbsp;some infrastructure updates. Sure, we could have shelled into the staging server and done a quick upgrade, but that's not how we roll on this project. It's really important to us that it be possible to easily provision hosts for Manifold, which means automating as much as possible. As Manifold grows, it relies on more and more services to run, which makes setting it up increasingly complex. With this release, Manifold needs all of the following configured on the server to run correctly:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Halloween!My name is Jojo Karlin and I am an English doctoral student and Digital Fellow at the Graduate Center, CUNY. I’ve joined Manifold this fall to help get the word out about what the team has been up to, and I am excited to investigate the generative potential built into this iterative, collaborative platform. I love the ways Manifold seeks to enrich scholarly publication by building communities of researchers engaged in collective annotation and networked reading.When friends and acquaintances unfamiliar with the field hear I work in “digital humanities,” they often react with anxieties about the death of print. Skeptical bibliophiles lament the impact of screens on humanity as they cite popular science articles about babies swiping pages of print books. &nbsp;Yet I remain a stalwart defender of books in their many forms. I grew up in a house lined with books and have a categorical weakness for library book sales and department book swaps; I also depend on my computer and smartphone as part of my reading practice.Books, even print-only, are not single-use -- people come to them and at them from different angles and at different times. I believe that the many ways we read books should be simultaneously available and that ideas deserve the full range of available outlets and expression. What I particularly love about Manifold is the way it bridges print and digital forms, giving presses and authors the opportunity to benefit from affordances of both -- utilizing digital features while reinforcing the value of print-based scholarship. Since joining Manifold, I have begun to see how the team approaches the transformations of text in recent years, the influx (sometimes numbing inundation) of social media, and the existing endeavors of numerous presses to engage scholarship digitally. “Building Manifold” gives me a sense of Manifold’s dual purpose-- platform construction and conceptual restructuring -- and Zach’s updates describe incremental decisions of development. By taking pains to publicly share the process of creating the tool, the Manifold team participates in the kind of transparent teamwork that the tool itself proposes. I look forward to sharing my perspective as well.In the coming months, I will help to surface some of the exciting progress that the team has been making. I will post updates about design, interviews with team members, and reflections on some of the trickier conceptual decisions. Even jumping in now, I have found the whole team -- Susan, Zach, Matt, Doug, Terence, Naomi, everyone!-- to be wonderfully welcoming and warm. I am looking forward to learning more, and I hope you will share in my excitement. If you have questions about Manifold, sign up for our newsletter, follow/star/love our git repository, follow @ManifoldScholar on Twitter, and feel free to get in touch. Thanks and be well,Jojo]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Jason indicated in this space earlier, Manifold is not simply an endeavor to create a better publishing platform; it is an answer to the challenge of rethinking and reframing the concept of scholarly publishing. In broad strokes, scholarly publishing is very much still a print-centric enterprise. Despite the vast libraries of electronic publications available, the systems, mindsets, and expectations of the greater university press culture—including those of authors and the academy—are engineered specifically for print.In terms of production, while many presses have augmented their procedures over the past two decades, those alterations tend to simply mirror print methods instead of refashioning them to account for digital materials and platforms. For other presses, third-party service providers, or packagers, handle the creation of electronic editions in parallel with print or as an afterthought to it. That is to say, even when print isn’t to be the only medium of publication, it still receives primacy over all other editions. When a question of formatting comes up, it’s a question to be resolved for print first. When internal elements are being scrutinized, they are done through a lens that foremost anticipates a static physical object.We’ve reached a moment, however, when we need to step back from print and see it in the proper context among the myriad means of expression scholars now have at their disposal. And it’s time to grapple with the fact that scholarly publishing involves more than books, more than journals, more than print. It’s not tied to paper; it’s not a function of the software it passes through. Instead, it’s the expression of content in the most meaningful and impactful ways possible. In that context, university presses must become adaptive and able to treat materials that aren’t always easily categorized or codified just as well as they do traditional vehicles like a journal or monograph.That is no small thing. The print paradigm has been refined and honed for generations. It is deeply ingrained, predicating the workings of every department within a press. Reengineering it is not something that will happen overnight. Nor should it. But nor should we let the print mold stand as a boulder, cordoning off those modes of expression that weren’t possible a few years ago or those just over the horizon. Exploring those opportunities is the commitment of the Manifold team. We bring together the perspectives of the university press, the scholar, and the technologist to hone in on new ways presses can present scholarship, realistically adapt existing procedures to account for a broad spectrum of publishing output, and technically deliver those varied means of expression to the readership in ways they are expecting as well as in ways they are not.As the Manifold digital projects editor, I am working closely with the platform developers at Cast Iron Coding, our partners at the GC Digital Scholarship Lab, authors, and press staff across departments here at Minnesota to help craft, test, and document replicable processes that will allow presses to shift from a publishing plan with a very specific terminus to one that celebrates projects as a spectrum of scholarly publication. In the weeks and months ahead, I’ll be returning here to talk more about the implications of that and the challenges we’re working through as we move from platform wireframes into more robust test cases.Stay tuned. The fun is just starting!—Terence Smyre, Manifold Digital Projects Editor]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Manifold Scholarship progresses through its first rounds of wireframes, editors at the University of Minnesota Press are already discussing the platform with authors and considering book projects. Manifold will have an impact on the full span of a project, from the early stages of researching and collecting data for a book, to the drafting of a proposal, to peer review and press evaluation, and across the iterative stages of a manuscript’s organic development leading to the peer reviewed, published edition. Just as Manifold is designed to transform the nature of scholarly publishing, we are also asking scholars, from their earliest articulations, to think elastically about the ways in which Manifold can expand their project beyond the static, physical book. As I’ve been asking editors and press authors to describe what makes a project suitable for publication on Manifold, I’ve found myself reflecting on the limitations the traditional print book can impose on scholars. One could argue that the traditional print scholarly monograph isn’t an accurate record of a research project. The fixed form of the book, for example, doesn’t reflect the long duration of research, the months of ethnography, the full compliment of data collection and archival deep-dives. The monograph doesn’t record the full chorus of voices that help shape a project, such as the feedback of colleagues and peers. Research is already iterative, benefitting from community dialogue and from interfacing with an array of media. It’s just that the current way of disseminating that research doesn’t reflect those pre-publication engagements. Up to now, when authors have wanted to share with readers materials that can’t fit into a print book such as audio and video files, teaching tools, or archival materials, they have often had to host them on a disconnected website. There’s often little travel between the website and the physical book, and these websites quickly fade away, disconnected by link rot or taken down from university servers when a scholar switches institutions. But these objects are never ancillary—they are part and parcel of the work itself. One potential Manifold author remarked to me that the traditional book doesn’t offer readers the chance to review the primary materials and say, “I disagree.” Manifold will allow authors to embed these objects within or alongside the text so that readers can chart their own course through all the elements that make up a scholarly book and research project. This feature is especially important to Manifold author Mara Mills, assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. Mills was initially attracted to Manifold because it provided an opportunity to develop an accessible multimedia publication:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Manifoldians! I'm Zach Davis, principle at Cast Iron Coding, a web development studio in Portland, Oregon. My team and I are responsible for UX design, visual design, and development of Manifold over the course of the grant, and it is my hope that I'll be able to post regular updates here&nbsp;detailing development and design decisions, challenges, and milestones over the course of the project. For now, however, I'd like to walk through the technology stack we've settled on, and the reasoning behind some of these choices. If anyone has any questions, please don't hesitate to post a comment! Where to find the source code As you know, one of the requirements of the grant funding this development is that Manifold be released as open source, and our current plan is to release Manifold under the GPLv3. For the time being, Manifold source code is stored in the ManifoldScholar/manifold Github repository. If you look at the ManifoldScholar GitHub organization, you'll see additional repositories for Manifold-API and Manifold-Client. Eventually, we&nbsp;hope to be able to provide the Manifold API as a stand-alone piece of software that can be used to parse, store, and expose ePub and Markdown documents over a RESTful API. In preparation for this, we're using a git subtree-split strategy to break the Manifold project into separate API and Client packages. These split repositories are updated significantly less frequently than the main Manifold repository. If your goal is to follow our development, for now your best bet will be to just watch the primary repository. We've already made significant progress on Manifold, although we're still far from an alpha release. We'd&nbsp;love it if you'd show your support for our project by starring our GitHub repo and keeping an eye on development. As we get closer to a stable alpha release in 2016, we'll invite community members to download and install their own instance of Manifold. Server-side&nbsp;architecture Manifold is split into the client application, and the server-side application. For now, these two applications share a repository to simplify development, but they are very distinct and meant to run independently of each other. The server-side application is built in Ruby and Rails. Specifically, we're using what is currently edge Rails, and what will soon be Rails 5. The development team&nbsp;thought long and hard about what server-side language to use, which was mainly a debate about the relative merits of using Ruby or Javascript on the server. While we have many years of experience working with PHP, and understand that it is still a popular, easy choice among academic developers, we felt strongly that the advantages of Ruby—strong OOP support, support for more functional styles, cleaner and more consistent syntax, and the maturity of Rails—outweighed the&nbsp;disadvantages of&nbsp;a more complex execution model and smaller (but by no means&nbsp;small) developer community. Laravel, the current leading PHP framework, for all its notable strengths, lacks the completeness and maturity of Rails and Active Record. Our choice to go with edge rails, rather than stable Rails 4.x, was driven by the fact that our server-side component is only serving an API, and Rails 5 will eventually ship with an api-only flag. This means that many aspects of Rails—the view layer, sprockets, etc—have been removed, making for a more lightweight framework overall. Another strong reason for choosing Rails was the presence of a strong HTML/XML parsing library in Nokogiri. Manifold deals heavily (but not exclusively) in EPUBs, which are HTML documents. To pull those documents apart and recreate them in the browser, we need a powerful parsing tool, which we've found in Nokogiri. The server side application exposes a REST style API to be consumed by the client. This API conforms to the style and conventions laid out by Steve Klabnik, Yehuda Katz, Dan Gebhardt, Tyler Kellen, and Ethan Resnick in the JSON API Specification. While it's important that developers expose all the things with APIs, it's challenging when each API follows its own idiosyncratic conventions. One of our goals on this project is to&nbsp;make Manifold as easy as possible to integrate into a presses existing infrastructure and environment, and following an established API specification helps us with that goal.&nbsp;Because the Manifold client application consumed Manifold's public API, integrators can be sure that the API is well tested and reliable. Authentication against the API will be handled&nbsp;using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).&nbsp;It will also be possible for a user to generate an API token by logging in through an OAuth provider such as Twitter or Facebook. **Client-side architecture** If we made a safe, conservative choice in Rails on the server-side, we've taken more of a leap on the client-side. The Manifold client is a single page application (SPA) that is built on React and Redux. Both are relatively new Javascript libraries (or frameworks, depending on how you look at things) that are rapidly gaining mindshare and popularity among front-end developers. For those who are unfamiliar, React is a Javascript library that simplifies the process of creating reusable components. Unlike other popular libraries such as Angular or Knockout, React does not attempt to solve the problem of two-way data binding. Instead, it is meant to be used with a specific&nbsp;architecture called Flux, which is structured around one-way data flow and immutability. Both React and Redux have a relatively small surface area. Redux APIs are small, and the library as a whole is under 15k. At Cast Iron, we've worked with many Javascript frameworks, in particular Angular and Backbone. Over time, client-side development has become quite complex, and it's our feeling that while Angular can work well on some projects, it doesn't do enough to reduce that complexity. By restricting the way in which data can flow through the application, and abstracting away the asynchronicity that can make client-side development challenging, we've found Redux and React to be a powerful combination that allows us to iterate quickly without sacrificing quality or maintainability. There are some challenges that come with developing a single page javascript application. For our purposes, the biggest challenge is to ensure that there is content loaded on the page before the javascript executes. We feel strongly that Manifold needs to be accessible to users with disability, to search engine crawlers, to screen readers, etc, and that we can't count on a javascript environment. For this reason, the Manifold client will be served by a small Node/Express application running on the server. Most of the javascript that executes in the browser is built to be isomorphic (now also known&nbsp;as universal), which means that care has been taken to ensure that it can be executed in a server-side context (node) and in a client-side context (the browser). The practical outcome of this approach is that the server-side component will be able to fully render the HTML before sending the page to the client, which solves the many accessibility and SEO problems. The advantages to the SPA approach are, well, manifold. The application will feel very fast, and we'll be vastly reducing the amount of data that's sent over the network. Complex UI elements, like the annotation pieces, will be have a much more stable, testable framework backing them. There will be more room for reusable components, and&nbsp;the various state-changes that can occur in the client-side application will be well tested. While we're diving in head-first on React + Redux, we are not, for now, following the current trend of doing only inline-CSS. For the time being, we'll be using the SASS preprocessor for all styles. At the language level, we're relying heavily on ES6 and upcoming ES7 features. We're using Babel to transpile ES6+ code down to ES5 &nbsp;so that it will run in IE9+, Firefox, and Safari. By using edge Javascript language features, our hope is that to some degree we will future proof Manifold code. For now, we're limiting ourselves to ES6+ features that are at stage 1 or greater, and acknowledge that there is some risk even with stage 1. We rely heavily on NPM for package management, and Webpack for transpiling assets during development, and for building assets for production. At Cast Iron, we've used Grunt and Gulp on other projects, but it looks to us like the React community is gravitating toward Webpack, and for good reasons. On Manifold, it's being used for automatically linting our code, for generating icon fonts from SVG icons, for transpiling ES6+ to ES5, and Sass to CSS. Testing Tests are important. They build confidence and help us to refactor without regressions. While we don't always follow test-driven-development practices, we do feel that it's important to have a robust test suite in place. On the API side, we're using rspec for tests. On the client-side we will be using Mocha. Server infrastructure and continuous integration DevOps and infrastructure automation are essential to our workflow at Cast Iron. We use Boxen to setup development instances of projects, and we use Puppet to deploy applications to staging and production environments. Our manifests for deploying Manifold are still in progress, but they're close. Soon, I hope to have a staging environment that's updated regularly via Jenkins, our continuous integration server.&nbsp;Soon, we'll also have Travis build notifications in place on the Github repository. To run Manifold, you'll need to have the following setup on a server:]]></summary>
