Gold, who is Associate Professor of English and Digital Humanities and Executive Officer of the M.A. Program in Liberal Studies at the Graduate Center, CUNY. I have been lucky to work with Matt for a couple of years now, through seminars on digital humanities praxis and textual studies, on DH tool-building projects like DH Box, on the editorial collective of the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, and with the digital fellows of the GC Digital Initiatives. His widespread commitment to textual scholarship and digital innovation, his seemingly tireless support of his students and digital experimentation, and his humility (which he may not even let me mention) never cease to amaze me. I have spent a lot of time discussing Manifold with Matt, but I was glad to get the chance to ask him more specifically about his personal motivations for developing a hybrid publishing platform.&nbsp; -- What matters most to you about Manifold? &nbsp;I think it\u2019s the overall excellence&nbsp;of the user experience. Our goal is to create a platform that will rival the reading experience of a commercial site like Medium but that is free and open-source. I\u2019m excited to see how various people will use it -- certainly our primary audience of university presses, but also a wider set of authors and publishers of all types. Cool. That sounds like a pretty noble mission to me.&nbsp; I\u2019m also excited about our team -- we have the University of Minnesota Press, which is doing exciting experimentation on both its editorial and production sides -- &nbsp;it\u2019s a Press that\u2019s willing to take risks with the way it thinks about the future of publishing. Working with a partner like that -- and with Doug Armato and his team in particular -- is a lot of fun.. And then we are lucky to be collaborating with Cast Iron Coding-- Zach Davis and his team are extremely talented and very much aware of the latest trends in web development. Manifold won\u2019t feel like a typical piece of academic technology, thanks to the work of Zach and his team. What\u2019s your ideal reading experience?&nbsp; For me, print is still most important as a reading experience. But I\u2019m never satisfied when I buy a printed book from a bookstore and then \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d I can\u2019t carry all of my books with me when I go on a trip, so I really want both print and digital at the point of purchase. For me, if I\u2019m going to read a book of theory or criticism, I\u2019m going to be reading it in print, but I also want to be able to easily pull it up on my laptop or phone when I\u2019m traveling or just happen to think of it during a meeting with a student, or I\u2019m doing some writing and I want to refer to it. I want the materiality of the print book, but for access and reference, the online version. And Manifold is precisely about achieving that hybrid experience. So we are producing print books, but we are also creating web-based interactive texts that open up new collective and social reading experiences. What are you reading now?&nbsp; I am reading (and loving) Barbarian Days by William Finnegan.&nbsp;Somehow, reading about waves feels&nbsp;like the right thing in this post-election moment--an escape from politics but also a reminder of how to make our way among larger and sometimes brutal forces. Who inspires your work?&nbsp; I tend to be inspired by my academic mentors. My first academic mentor was Robert D. Richardson, Jr., who is a biographer of Thoreau and Emerson (his biography of Emerson remains one of my favorite books). I\u2019m still in awe of his erudition and research and writing skills. I\u2019m also inspired on a daily level by my colleagues at the Graduate Center and across CUNY, especially by the students I work with. --After Matt answered all the questions, we had the chance to speak more broadly about Manifold and the features that specifically address readers\u2019 needs.
