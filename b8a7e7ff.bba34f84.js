Terence had never had Bulgarian food before, and said it was sumptuous! \u201cIt was tough to choose, but I don\u2019t know how I could have done better than with the Chicken Kavarma.\u201d His response to the cayenne wine sauce with San Marzano tomatoes: \u201cWow. Just wow!\u201d **Cheese** : None! Terence gets no end of grief for not liking cheese. He can eat it; he just doesn\u2019t like it. (_Loathe_ it may be closer to the mark, actually.) And that comes up very often. But on Monday night he sat down to break bread with a table of folks for whom there was a majority that also didn\u2019t like cheese. That\u2019s never happened before. It may never happen again. He says he\u2019ll savor that experience till the end of his days.Thanks for reading!
