Indiana University Press is excited to join the University of Minnesota Press and its partners in piloting Manifold, to help it meet the changing needs of authors, scholars, and readers. The Manifold platform will provide IUP with a unique content vehicle for born-digital scholarship, allowing content in the platform to remain evergreen, while providing media-rich experiences for readers across the spectrum of devices. We are committed to opening up content to authors and those accessing their work in radically transformative ways.
