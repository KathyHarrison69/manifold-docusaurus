Her passion, excitment, and joy for her work were not only tangible, they were utterly catching. Much of the press's focus is devoted to the recovery of primary documents and scholarship in both Spanish and English, from before the Mexican Revolution and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo through to the 1960s.
