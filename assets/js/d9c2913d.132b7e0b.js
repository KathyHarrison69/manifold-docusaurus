Figueiredo. The conversation revolved around integrating Manifold with their series, which encourages writers to experiment with form, style, content, and approach to break down the barrier between the scholarly and the creative. Reviewing the work that Jeff and his team had undertaken in preparation for the meetings, Terence clearly saw that Intermezzo was fully invested in exploring and breaking boundaries. Already online was a research project analyzing the content of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) job posts to trace how they rhetorically depict human actants. Made up of a series of brief texts and Google On Air Hangouts between senior scholars, this project demonstrates the kind of investigative and creative project that Manifold enables. Even after all their work ahead of the meetings, the Intermezzo team was glad to have had Terence come down for the in-person training. While we\u2019ve worked from the beginning to make the system as intuitive as possible, Manifold affords so much functionality beyond the obvious that having a guided and dedicated dive into its capabilities really makes a difference. \u201cWith this team already so well versed in the platform, we were able to focus in on the ways Manifold could streamline their existing production processes and explore new tactics they could leverage, depending on the needs of a particular project. With Manifold\u2019s versatility, authors and editors have a range of editorial options available to them that are really fun to plumb in this kind of group setting.\u201d Terence\u2019s report suggests that much of what they discussed will be portable. \u201cIt was exciting to hear how the themes we discussed could be used not only in relation to Manifold but also in their respective classrooms\u2014from emerging trends in digital scholarship to finding ways within their institutions to make scholarly content more readily accessible and financially viable for students.\u201d",date:"2019-10-08T00:00:00.000Z",formattedDate:"October 8, 2019",tags:[],truncated:!0,prevItem:{title:"Manifold Digital Services Spotlight: Lapham's Quarterly",permalink:"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifolddigitalservicesspotlightlaphamsquarterly"},nextItem:{title:"Manifold Version 4.0 Overview",permalink:"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/manifoldversion40overview"}},s=[],c={toc:s};function d(e){var t=e.components,r=(0,o.Z)(e,["components"]);return(0,i.kt)("wrapper",(0,n.Z)({},c,r,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
