Just wow!\u201d **Cheese** : None! Terence gets no end of grief for not liking cheese. He can eat it; he just doesn\u2019t like it. (_Loathe_ it may be closer to the mark, actually.) And that comes up very often. But on Monday night he sat down to break bread with a table of folks for whom there was a majority that also didn\u2019t like cheese. That\u2019s never happened before. It may never happen again. He says he\u2019ll savor that experience till the end of his days.Thanks for reading!
