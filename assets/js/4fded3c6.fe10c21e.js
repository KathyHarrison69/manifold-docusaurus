Manifold will have an impact on the full span of a project, from the early stages of researching and collecting data for a book, to the drafting of a proposal, to peer review and press evaluation, and across the iterative stages of a manuscript\u2019s organic development leading to the peer reviewed, published edition. Just as Manifold is designed to transform the nature of scholarly publishing, we are also asking scholars, from their earliest articulations, to think elastically about the ways in which Manifold can expand their project beyond the static, physical book. As I\u2019ve been asking editors and press authors to describe what makes a project suitable for publication on Manifold, I\u2019ve found myself reflecting on the limitations the traditional print book can impose on scholars. One could argue that the traditional print scholarly monograph isn\u2019t an accurate record of a research project. The fixed form of the book, for example, doesn\u2019t reflect the long duration of research, the months of ethnography, the full compliment of data collection and archival deep-dives. The monograph doesn\u2019t record the full chorus of voices that help shape a project, such as the feedback of colleagues and peers. Research is already iterative, benefitting from community dialogue and from interfacing with an array of media. It\u2019s just that the current way of disseminating that research doesn\u2019t reflect those pre-publication engagements. Up to now, when authors have wanted to share with readers materials that can\u2019t fit into a print book such as audio and video files, teaching tools, or archival materials, they have often had to host them on a disconnected website. There\u2019s often little travel between the website and the physical book, and these websites quickly fade away, disconnected by link rot or taken down from university servers when a scholar switches institutions. But these objects are never ancillary\u2014they are part and parcel of the work itself. One potential Manifold author remarked to me that the traditional book doesn\u2019t offer readers the chance to review the primary materials and say, \u201cI disagree.\u201d Manifold will allow authors to embed these objects within or alongside the text so that readers can chart their own course through all the elements that make up a scholarly book and research project. This feature is especially important to Manifold author Mara Mills, assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. Mills was initially attracted to Manifold because it provided an opportunity to develop an accessible multimedia publication:",date:"2016-01-25T00:00:00.000Z",formattedDate:"January 25, 2016",tags:[],truncated:!0,prevItem:{title:"Starting Points with the Manifold Digital Projects Editor",permalink:"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/startingpointswiththemanifolddigitalprojectseditor"},nextItem:{title:"A Technical Introduction to Manifold",permalink:"/manifold-docusaurus/blog/atechnicalintroductiontomanifold"}},l=[],c={toc:l};function d(e){var t=e.components,o=(0,a.Z)(e,["components"]);return(0,n.kt)("wrapper",(0,r.Z)({},c,o,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
