Bee and gopher by Jojo Karlin Last week Terence was in Montreal, Quebec, meeting with the three-person staff of Concordia University Press, which was established in 2016 and will this fall publish its first books.\u201cIt\'s exciting for a new scholarly publisher like Concordia University Press to be a part of this pilot,\u201d noted interim director Geoffrey Little. \u201cWe look forward to learning how Manifold can help us publish our peer-reviewed open-access books.\u201dDespite priding himself as being directionally adept, Terence found himself a bit misplaced when he made his way to the Webster Library\u2014home of the press\u2014for the first sessions of the trip. \u201cI was a bit early, and as I was making my way around a woman who had walked past me just a moment prior called out my name. It was Meredith Carruthers, the press\u2019s Editorial and Production Coordinator; she recognized me from my email avatar. That was definitely a first, especially given how bad I am at making avatars of myself.\u201dAfter introductions and a brief tour, Terence led Meredith and the press\u2019s intern Charles on a guided tour of the platform, beginning with its origins and aims, demoing its present capabilities, and concluding with a review of the roadmap for future development. \u201cI always love doing this opening session because it really reveals what the system is and serves as a catalyst for so many of the discussions that come in the later sessions.\u201d"" What a fantastic space the Webster Library provided. Rich with color, and featuring high ceilings and interesting design choices that catch the eye\u2014especially all the living plants that adorned the walls\u2014made this such an ideal place to do our work. ""Geoffrey caught up with Meredith and Terence for lunch, where they had the chance to talk about their backgrounds and what brought them to publishing before they pivoted back to the library for a couple of sessions considering workflow and discovery and presentation.
