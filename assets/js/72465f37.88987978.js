While his habits have changed since the days when he was a Ph.D. student in English at the CUNY Graduate Center, Zach says it\u2019s "still a book most of the time. It depends on what kind of text. I don\u2019t read theory and criticism the way I used to. For short forms, I will read on the web or my phone, but for reading, I still like the physical artifact.\u201d We talked a bit about the different demands of different types of reading. When he was working on his dissertation, Zach categorized himself as a transcriber. He would cite passages as a way of thinking through the content. Now while working on Manifold, he imagines the sort of tools that would have facilitated this sort of reading. He says he also spent much of his academic life reading digital texts, which were often easier to track down.
