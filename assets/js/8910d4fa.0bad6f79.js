First we dug into development progress and plans for the roadmap. With Version 2.1 out just before Thanksgiving, things are on track. We chugged through and then reviewed the features to determine which were in line with the milestones written into the grant and which were in keeping with the project but beyond the reach of our funding.Given the speed with which Zach and Max have been responding to issues raised in the press pilots on top of a continued grueling pace of new feature creation, we needed to reassess and allocate development hours.

","\xa0"," Once we made it through the roadmap and combed through the existing feature requests, we had lunch to repower before our discussion of analytics. Susan had prepared notes regarding open-access analytics needs, incorporating feedback from press partners. We discussed what Manifold analytics would be apart from Google Analytics.

Much of the discussion centered on how teachers might best organize course materials on Manifold. Project collections were developed for publishers, but offer a mechanism for arranging titles. As the development team moves forward, they are careful about creating not just easy but sustainable and appropriate solutions. We determined that a user page may be the best level for those sorts of controls, but developing that interface will take careful consideration.","\xa0"," As the day wore on, we dove deeper into discussions of project sustainability. With half the first set of pilot presses trained and the next set coming up quickly, we know we need to plan for the future.
