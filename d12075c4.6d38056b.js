I like that we\u2019re providing a platform for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have one or would have to rely on a separate vendor. Zach and his team at Cast Iron have done a lot of work to make sure that Manifold is easy to use, and I think that\u2019s crucial. I\u2019m a big fan of bringing as much work in-house as you can and building up your own experience and knowledge base.&nbsp;With Manifold, publishers will have the ability to serve their materials on the web in an elegant way and make use of all the various forms of media the digital environment allows.I\u2019m curious about your experience before Manifold? Can you tell us something about your time at Nebraska?I was at Nebraska for twelve-ish years, and I was in both the books and journals programs, but I primarily oversaw journals production. That involved working with journal editors and authors, evaluating manuscripts for structure, style, mechanics, and copyright concerns, coding manuscripts to our production system, preparing notes and directions for our freelance copy editors and our in-house typesetter, evaluating edits and proofs and corrections to them, and then working out print runs, etc. And I did some general business/budgetary stuff for those parts of the process I worked with. It was a lot, but it was a great team. I oversaw a typesetter dedicated to journals work and a project supervisor who I was glad to see take over for me when I left.So full cycle?Full cycle. I think when I was there we had thirty journals. Also, just before I left, we began working with Nebraska\u2019s extension program and helping them with their publications. The extension publications are a really good use case for Manifold\u2014often shorter documents, reports, created by experts in the field with outreach programs, all the way up to larger spiral bound publications.Your text-preparation experience at Nebraska was pretty soup to nuts?Yeah. It was fun. I was also part of a small team that helped implement Scribe\u2019s Well-Formed Document Workflow for the press, changing over from a do-it-yourself coding system to a more regimented, structured XML workflow.So you were ready. You knew Manifold was the thing we needed.It\u2019s funny, I remember in April 2015 when the press release went out about Manifold, I thought \u201cthis is what we should be doing\u2014we should be doing this\u201d and that if any position opened up, I was going to throw my hat in. Because there\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t. When I saw the advertisement later that summer I was excited, but I also didn\u2019t expect to get a call, because I was sure everyone and their brother would be banging down the door for the opportunity. It\u2019s just too awesome. It\u2019s worked out great for all of us.I feel very lucky. This is a dream job. I mean, where else do you get to work on such an important and far-reaching project with a team of just absolutely awesome people. We\u2019ve built this amazing platform in just a few years, and we still are able to cover important questions like Beastmaster or Krull on Slack. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that.Now that you\u2019re starting to work with presses of different sizes, how do you adapt to different workflows? The big thing I\u2019ve noticed is that getting to EPUB is not always an easy reach for some publishers. They can get to it, but it\u2019s roundabout\u2014exporting from InDesign or Google Docs\u2014and they don\u2019t have that same fundamental control over them or the experience of breaking into the EPUB and doing the fine tuning.For most university presses, that\u2019s not going to be an issue\u2014they\u2019ll do it in house with Scribe or P-Shift or they\u2019ll outsource it to a vendor who can do it for them. In those cases, you\u2019re going to get something that works just fine. We\u2019ve tested EPUB files from a host of different vendors, and we\u2019ve never had any problem\u2014they all work in Manifold. For smaller or newer publishers, getting to that point is not always as easy, which is why it\u2019s so nice to have support for Word and Google Doc ingestion. Likewise for those willing to branch out to Markdown and HTML. Markdown, I think, is an easy reach, and if you\u2019re open to that, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m all about the Markdown.Me, too!Really? Are you trying it?Yeah\u2014I am working on a book for a friend because she teaches books that are out of copyright. Her class chose an early American novel, Hope Leslie, that has no EPUB but exists on the Internet Archive as a PDF and in OCRed plaintext. It\u2019s super messy and I\u2019m teaching myself how to structure it in Markdown. The plan is to get it up on CUNY Manifold so she can teach with it. If I trusted my ability to program, I\u2019d run some scripts, but I\u2019m mostly cleaning by hand.So you\u2019re just taking the dirty OCR and running some scripts on it and making it look good?More like I am running find and replace.I\u2019ve done that a lot of times\u2014and even just doing that, I\u2019ve found, is a big step up and often very useful for those around you. Most of the \u201cscripts\u201d I\u2019ve written are simply just chains of find and replace.Which leads me to the question about smaller presses\u2014for the presses that don\u2019t have EPUB production built into their system, how much do you anticipate in terms of teaching?It\u2019ll be a lot of prep work and dialoguing. Talking to all the pilot programs before I go out for my in-person training to see what their workflows look like and getting some sample files. I\u2019m looking to craft a roadmap and a process that a publisher can easily use and replicate as a sort of touchstone that they can later spring from into more complex or creative uses of the platform. And hopefully during the training, we can work through the bulk of the big questions in person. After that I expect there will still be a host of fringe questions that we can take care of in a venue like this a web call] or in our&nbsp;[Slack channel. It\u2019s really cool to have the #Pilot channel on Slack so that people who have similar sorts of approaches or levels of experience are able to interact directly with one another and get good practical feedback. Very cool! We advocate conversation and community.That\u2019s the way you learn! It\u2019s nice to be put in touch with others grappling with similar issues and to dynamically engage with those questions. A lot of times you don\u2019t know who to talk to or reach out to, and to have that built into the fabric of our program is really cool.Can you give a list of technical skills or aptitudes that you think would be important for a Manifold editor at a press?Zach and his team have made it amazingly easy to get stuff into the system and looking beautiful. So the first response that bubbles up for me is to say something like, I don\u2019t think you need a bunch of technical know-how . . .I\u2019ve told people that it can help to have some familiarity with Markdown, a basic text editor, maybe Wordpress or some HTML.Yeah, that\u2019s a more useful answer. I\u2019d say CSS as well. If you\u2019ve even done some cursory work with CSS or HTML, you\u2019re going to be just fine. And really, all the heavy lifting will be in file prep. If for whatever reason you\u2019re working with file types that Manifold can\u2019t ingest natively, then it\u2019s going to be about being willing to stretch yourself and not being afraid of technology. Nothing that anybody does is going to break anything. If you encounter problems, we\u2019re going to be there to help. The big thing is not to be afraid, embrace the different tools that are available, cultivate a pioneering spirit, and just experiment. You don\u2019t have to know exactly what you\u2019re doing, but if you\u2019re willing to throw yourself out there, then you\u2019re going to be just fine. And more than likely you\u2019re going to find it\u2019s a lot easier than you expect. You might hit a few initial road bumps, but once you\u2019ve cleared them you\u2019ll see this is a lot different or easier and not as cumbersome as you imagined it to be. Especially with Manifold.It helps to have some understanding of where different operations take place.Oh definitely. And that guides us as we are creating documentation. It\u2019s really important to understand how things are working and how you can affect what you\u2019re seeing on screen. In a conference call recently I had a question about linked footnotes, and the person on the call asked if Manifold was automating that process, automatically creating a link between the text and the note. (Manifold isn\u2019t doing that; it\u2019s simply honoring the source document\u2019s links.) That\u2019s not clear when you\u2019re just coming to this. So we are working really hard to make sure that those kinds of questions have good answers in our documentation. That if you aren\u2019t sure how something works or how to change what you\u2019re seeing, there\u2019s an answer with clear steps you can take to get the results you want.So having some basic skills helps, but truly if you can create a document on a computer, you can create a Manifold project?Yeah. If you can navigate a web page and use a browser, working in Manifold isn\u2019t harder than that.What do you anticipate with the presses to come? Do you have particular things you\u2019re looking out for?I\u2019m sure there will be lots of obstacles, but I\u2019ll be doing my homework ahead of time so I can be as prepared as possible when I\u2019m out there. I\u2019m versed in Mac and PC systems, but it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve used a PC\u2014Nebraska was PC-based and I know a lot of university presses are\u2014so I\u2019m going to dust off my old desktop beforehand to make sure I\u2019m fluent again with those systems. But then in terms of production, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see where they\u2019re leaving off Word, if they\u2019re leaving off Word and getting to other document types. Because almost everyone we talked to can get to PDF, but as you know Manifold doesn\u2019t do PDF in the reader. So what is the step before? And then exploring what they\u2019re doing and how to get from there into Manifold. That\u2019ll be interesting, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult. I think it\u2019ll be more about navigating the procedural nuances for the different houses.Do you have a sense of how many people will be in your training sessions?I\u2019ll know beforehand. The first press, Athabasca, is around eight people, I believe. Usually it\u2019ll be pretty production-oriented, but some will be coming from editorial and some will just be from different backgrounds who have the bandwidth and the gusto. When I go out, I\u2019ll be doing a general overview for everyone so they have an idea of \u201cwhat is this thing we signed up for?\u201d, getting an appreciation for what Manifold can do for them and having the opportunity to ask questions, before breaking off into smaller focus groups. It tends to work best when you have eight to ten people crowding around a computer and a couple monitors\u2014you can really get into the nitty gritty and get some good work accomplished that way.Do the presses have collections they have pinpointed? Most of them yes. Some have works coming down the pipe.Have you ever been to any of the presses before?Not a one!Have you been to any of the cities?I\u2019ve been to Atlanta before. I\u2019ve never been to Canada . . .You\u2019ve never been to Canada? Who are you?The guy who\u2019s never been to Canada. I\u2019ve never been to the UK, and I\u2019ve never been to Jamaica. I\u2019ve not been to Temple. Have you been to Philadelphia?Yes. And I\u2019ve run up the steps. And yes. I\u2019ll be running up the steps again. I\u2019ve been to Seattle, but not to the press.I\u2019ve never been to Bloomington, Indiana, or Cincinnati. The only things I know about Cincinnati I learned from WKRP in Cincinnati\u2014so not much.What will you read on the plane?I don\u2019t know! I\u2019m just finishing Don\u2019t Look Behind You by Samuel Rogers. I\u2019ve got a few books on the nightstand that will make good travel fare. I\u2019ve never read the Harry Potter books.Ever?Ever. I read the first one not that long ago. It was really good! I have the second one just waiting for me.(At this point I recommended the Witch, Please podcast.)That sounds cool. I don\u2019t know what else I\u2019m going to queue up. Do you know of the Flavia De Luce books? I know of them\u2014my mother shares my New York Public Library account and sometimes books just show up. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to have one or two of those. I know I\u2019ve got a physics book. And Neil Gaiman\u2019s Norse Mythology.Do you have any last things to say in preparation for Travels with Terence?I\u2019m just really excited to get started.
