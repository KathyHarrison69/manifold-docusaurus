And because it\u2019s so easy to set up an instance, they start thinking of how they can use it for projects they have now and how they can both reinvigorate old titles and cultivate future ones in ways not available to them previously. Between sessions there was always a lot of talk among the various groups in the room, thinking about all the different projects they could bring to Manifold and the ways it could help enrich them.
