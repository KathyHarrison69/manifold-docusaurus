The Manifold Documentation Reference section provides:

- a [glossary](/docs/reference/glossary) of Manifold-specific vocabulary,
- a description of [phrasal search](/docs/reference/search) operation in the application,
- an overview of some common [interface](/docs/reference/interface) functionality,
- a table of all the available [metadata fields](/docs/reference/metadata) available on the platform, and
- a listing of available [download packages](/docs/reference/downloads).

As the documentation evolves, we expect these sections to expand. We encourage the community to request revisions and to contribute to our documentation. Please open an issue or submit a pull request at [our documentation repository](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-docs-jekyll).
