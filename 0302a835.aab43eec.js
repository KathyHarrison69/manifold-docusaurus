Keeping four services running on a server (or on multiple servers) is not without its complexities. If we run these on Ubuntu Trusty (v14), for example, we need Upstart scripts that manage the services. If we run Manifold on Ubuntu Xenial (v16), then we're going to need Systemd scripts. If it runs on older versions of Centos or Redhat, then we'll probably need some init.d scripts.

Needing to support Postgres 9.4 got us thinking about deploying Manifold to Ubuntu Xenial, which in turn led us to revisit our manifests.

That's done now, and we're deploying Manifold to Xenial and fully managing its environment and all dependencies via Puppet. Revisiting this infrastructure has also given us an opportunity to reflect further on Manifold's installation story and continue discussions about how we can make Manifold easy for other presses to adopt and install. ",Object(o.b)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"New Features")," We did manage to slip a few important features into this week's release. The full list is below, but there's one in particular I want to highlight. This release includes a scheduler that runs constantly in the background while Manifold is running. One of the things this scheduler does is trigger a background job for fetching tweets related to projects in Manifold. That job currently runs hourly. Editors can use twitter search terms to describe what kind of tweets Manifold should pull in for a given project. This gives editors quite a bit of flexibility. For example, Manifold might watch the author's twitter account for all tweets with a specific hash tag. Or, it might watch twitter in general for all tweets that include a given hashtag. Our tweet fetching service accepts multiple search terms, so it's possible for a project to follow multiple accounts and hashtags. These tweets show up on the project activity feed. Readers can browse through the historical activity for a project and see the events\u2014texts being added, tweets about the project, new resources uploaded\u2014that took place as the project became a published book (see screenshot, below). Our hope is that showing this activity helps make public the iterative aspects of authorship.
